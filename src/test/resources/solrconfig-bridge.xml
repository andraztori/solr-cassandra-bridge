<config>
  <!-- In all configuration below, a prefix of "solr." for class names
       is an alias that causes solr to search appropriate packages,
       including org.apache.solr.(search|update|request|core|analysis)

       You may also specify a fully qualified Java classname if you
       have your own custom plugins.
    -->

  <!-- Controls what version of Lucene various components of Solr
       adhere to.  Generally, you want to use the latest version to
       get all bug fixes and improvements. It is highly recommended
       that you fully re-index after changing this setting as it can
       affect both how text is indexed and queried.
  -->
  <luceneMatchVersion>4.6</luceneMatchVersion>

  <!-- <lib/> directives can be used to instruct Solr to load an Jars
       identified and use them to resolve any "plugins" specified in
       your solrconfig.xml or schema.xml (ie: Analyzers, Request
       Handlers, etc...).

       All directories and paths are resolved relative to the
       instanceDir.

       Please note that <lib/> directives are processed in the order
       that they appear in your solrconfig.xml file, and are "stacked" 
       on top of each other when building a ClassLoader - so if you have 
       plugin jars with dependencies on other jars, the "lower level" 
       dependency jars should be loaded first.

       If a "./lib" directory exists in your instanceDir, all files
       found in it are included as if you had used the following
       syntax...
       
              <lib dir="./lib" />
    -->

  <!-- A 'dir' option by itself adds any files found in the directory 
       to the classpath, this is useful for including all jars in a
       directory.

       When a 'regex' is specified in addition to a 'dir', only the
       files in that directory which completely match the regex
       (anchored on both ends) will be included.

       If a 'dir' option (with or without a regex) is used and nothing
       is found that matches, a warning will be logged.

       The examples below can be used to load some solr-contribs along 
       with their external dependencies.
    -->
  
  <!-- Data Directory

       Used to specify an alternate directory to hold all index data
       other than the default ./data under the Solr home.  If
       replication is in use, this should match the replication
       configuration.

  <!-- The DirectoryFactory to use for indexes.
       
       solr.StandardDirectoryFactory is filesystem
       based and tries to pick the best implementation for the current
       JVM and platform.  solr.NRTCachingDirectoryFactory, the default,
       wraps solr.StandardDirectoryFactory and caches small files in memory
       for better NRT performance.

       One can force a particular implementation via solr.MMapDirectoryFactory,
       solr.NIOFSDirectoryFactory, or solr.SimpleFSDirectoryFactory.

       solr.RAMDirectoryFactory is memory based, not
       persistent, and doesn't work with replication.
    -->
  <directoryFactory name="DirectoryFactory" 
                    class="${solr.directoryFactory:solr.NRTCachingDirectoryFactory}"/> 

  <!-- The CodecFactory for defining the format of the inverted index.
       The default implementation is SchemaCodecFactory, which is the official Lucene
       index format, but hooks into the schema to provide per-field customization of
       the postings lists and per-document values in the fieldType element
       (postingsFormat/docValuesFormat). Note that most of the alternative implementations
       are experimental, so if you choose to customize the index format, its a good
       idea to convert back to the official format e.g. via IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader)
       before upgrading to a newer version to avoid unnecessary reindexing.
  -->
  <codecFactory class="solr.SchemaCodecFactory"/>

  <!-- To enable dynamic schema REST APIs, use the following for <schemaFactory>:
  
       <schemaFactory class="ManagedIndexSchemaFactory">
         <bool name="mutable">true</bool>
         <str name="managedSchemaResourceName">managed-schema</str>
       </schemaFactory>
       
       When ManagedIndexSchemaFactory is specified, Solr will load the schema from
       he resource named in 'managedSchemaResourceName', rather than from schema.xml.
       Note that the managed schema resource CANNOT be named schema.xml.  If the managed
       schema does not exist, Solr will create it after reading schema.xml, then rename
       'schema.xml' to 'schema.xml.bak'. 
       
       Do NOT hand edit the managed schema - external modifications will be ignored and
       overwritten as a result of schema modification REST API calls.

       When ManagedIndexSchemaFactory is specified with mutable = true, schema
       modification REST API calls will be allowed; otherwise, error responses will be
       sent back for these requests.

  <!-- Request Handlers 

       http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrRequestHandler

       Incoming queries will be dispatched to a specific handler by name
       based on the path specified in the request.

       Legacy behavior: If the request path uses "/select" but no Request
       Handler has that name, and if handleSelect="true" has been specified in
       the requestDispatcher, then the Request Handler is dispatched based on
       the qt parameter.  Handlers without a leading '/' are accessed this way
       like so: http://host/app/[core/]select?qt=name  If no qt is
       given, then the requestHandler that declares default="true" will be
       used or the one named "standard".

       If a Request Handler is declared with startup="lazy", then it will
       not be initialized until the first request that uses it.
